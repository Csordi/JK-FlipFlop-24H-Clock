# JK-FlipFlop-24H-Clock
TTL Clock without any programed devices. The clock use only logical ICs.

- 24H clock (no AM/PM mode)
- Time format: HH:MM:SS
- 6pcs red 7segment display
- 6-18V DC IN
- Almost fully through-hole design (only one component is SMD)
- KiCad 5 project files

I designed the circuit for parts available at local stores. You may not be able to easily find a source for the display or other component.
